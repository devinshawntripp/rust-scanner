Each * compiles to a separate [^/]*? regex group, and when the match fails, V8's regex engine backtracks exponentially across all possible splits. The time complexity is O(4^N) where N is the number of * characters. With N=15, a single minimatch() call takes ~2 seconds. With N=34, it hangs effectively forever.

is a minimal matching utility for converting glob expressions into JavaScript RegExp objects. Prior to version 10.2.3, 9.0.7, 8.0.6, 7.4.8, 6.2.2, 5.1.8, 4.2.5, and 3.1.3, `matchOne()` performs unbounded recursive backtracking when a glob pattern contains multiple non-adjacent `**` (GLOBSTAR) segments and the input path does not match. The time complexity is O(C(n, k)) -- binomial -- where `n` is the number of path segments and `k` is the number of globstars. With k=11 and n=30, a call to the default `minimatch()` API stalls for roughly 5 seconds. With k=13, it exceeds 15 seconds. No memoization or call budget exists to bound this behavior. Any application where an attacker can influence the glob pattern passed to `minimatch()` is vulnerable. The realistic attack surface includes build tools and task runners that accept user-supplied glob arguments (ESLint, Webpack, Rollup config), multi-tenant systems where one tenant configures glob-based rules that run in a shared process, admin or developer interfaces that accept ignore-rule or filter configuration as globs, and CI/CD pipelines that evaluate user-submitted config files containing glob patterns. An attacker who can place a crafted pattern into any of these paths can stall the Node.js event loop for tens of seconds per invocation. The pattern is 56 bytes for a 5-second stall and does not require authentication in contexts where pattern input is part of the feature. Versions 10.2.3, 9.0.7, 8.0.6, 7.4.8, 6.2.2, 5.1.8, 4.2.5, and 3.1.3 fix the issue.","cvss":[{"source":"security-advisories@github.com","type":"Secondary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H","metrics":{"baseScore":7.5,"exploitabilityScore":3.9,"impactScore":3.6},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2026-27903","epss":0.00047,"percentile":0.14463,"date":"2026-02-26"}],"cwes":[{"cve":"CVE-2026-27903","cwe":"CWE-407","source":"security-advisories@github.com","type":"Primary"}]}],"matchDetails":[{"type":"exact-direct-match","matcher":"javascript-matcher","searchedBy":{"language":"javascript","namespace":"github:language:javascript","package":{"name":"minimatch","version":"9.0.5"}},"found":{"vulnerabilityID":"GHSA-7r86-cg39-jmmj","versionConstraint":">=9.0.0,<9.0.7 (semantic)"},"fix":{"suggestedVersion":"9.0.7"}}],"artifact":{"id":"2d45e4f2c6446db9","name":"minimatch","version":"9.0.5","type":"npm","locations":[{"path":"/usr/local/lib/node_modules/npm/node_modules/minimatch/package.json","layerID":"sha256:3c6d70eb622327a1b441dd21f3762dbe4388412255eee9d2dd74bf16fcc3ed26","accessPath":"/usr/local/lib/node_modules/npm/node_modules/minimatch/package.json","annotations":{"evidence":"primary"}}],"language":"javascript","licenses":["ISC"],"cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:minimatch_project:minimatch:9.0.5:*:*:*:*:node.js:*:*"],"purl":"pkg:npm/minimatch@9.0.5","upstreams":[]}},{"vulnerability":{"id":"CVE-2019-1010024","dataSource":"https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2019-1010024","namespace":"debian:distro:debian:12","severity":"Negligible","urls":[],"description":"GNU Libc current is affected by: Mitigation bypass.

Prior to version 10.2.3, 9.0.7, 8.0.6, 7.4.8, 6.2.2, 5.1.8, 4.2.5, and 3.1.4, nested `*()` extglobs produce regexps with nested unbounded quantifiers (e.g. `(?:(?:a|b)*)*`), which exhibit catastrophic backtracking in V8. With a 12-byte pattern `*(*(*(a|b)))` and an 18-byte non-matching input, `minimatch()` stalls for over 7 seconds. Adding a single nesting level or a few input characters pushes this to minutes. This is the most severe finding: it is triggered by the default `minimatch()` API with no special options, and the minimum viable pattern is only 12 bytes. The same issue affects `+()` extglobs equally. Versions 10.2.3, 9.0.7, 8.0.6, 7.4.8, 6.2.2, 5.1.8, 4.2.5, and 3.1.4 fix the

This issue has been fixed in version 7.5.8.","cvss":[{"source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N","metrics":{"baseScore":7.1,"exploitabilityScore":1.9,"impactScore":5.2},"vendorMetadata":{}},{"source":"security-advisories@github.com","type":"Secondary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N","metrics":{"baseScore":7.1,"exploitabilityScore":1.9,"impactScore":5.2},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2026-26960","epss":0.00012,"percentile":0.01738,"date":"2026-02-26"}],"cwes":[{"cve":"CVE-2026-26960","cwe":"CWE-22","source":"security-advisories@github.com","type":"Primary"}]}],"matchDetails":[{"type":"exact-direct-match","matcher":"javascript-matcher","searchedBy":{"language":"javascript","namespace":"github:language:javascript","package":{"name":"tar","version":"7.4.3"}},"found":{"vulnerabilityID":"GHSA-83g3-92jg-28cx","versionConstraint":"<7.5.8 (semantic)"},"fix":{"suggestedVersion":"7.5.8"}}],"artifact":{"id":"f1798e2aef0c5788","name":"tar","version":"7.4.3","type":"npm","locations":[{"path":"/usr/local/lib/node_modules/npm/node_modules/node-gyp/node_modules/tar/package.json","layerID":"sha256:3c6d70eb622327a1b441dd21f3762dbe4388412255eee9d2dd74bf16fcc3ed26","accessPath":"/usr/local/lib/node_modules/npm/node_modules/node-gyp/node_modules/tar/package.json","annotations":{"evidence":"primary"}}],"language":"javascript","licenses":["ISC"],"cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:tar_project:tar:7.4.3:*:*:*:*:node.js:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:isaacs:tar:7.4.3:*:*:*:*:node.js:*:*"],"purl":"pkg:npm/tar@7.4.3","upstreams":[]}},{"vulnerability":{"id":"CVE-2019-1010022","dataSource":"https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2019-1010022","namespace":"debian:distro:debian:12","severity":"Negligible","urls":[],"description":"GNU Libc current is affected by: Mitigation bypass.

Note that the attacker must have control over both, the size as well as the alignment arguments of the memalign function to be able to exploit this.  The size parameter must be close enough to PTRDIFF_MAX so as to overflow size_t along with the large alignment argument.

Prior to versions 8.0.3, 5.2.2, 4.0.4, and 3.5.1, attempting to parse a patch whose filename headers contain the line break characters `\\r`, `\\u2028`, or `\\u2029` can cause the `parsePatch` method to enter an infinite loop. It then consumes memory without limit until the process crashes due to running out of memory. Applications are therefore likely to be vulnerable to a denial-of-service attack if they call `parsePatch` with a user-provided patch as input. A large payload is not needed to trigger the vulnerability, so size limits on user input do not provide any protection. Furthermore, some applications may be vulnerable even when calling `parsePatch` on a patch generated by the application itself if the user is nonetheless able to control the filename headers (e.g. by directly providing the filenames of the files to be diffed). The `applyPatch` method is similarly affected if (and only if) called with a string representation of a patch as an argument, since under the hood it parses that string using `parsePatch`. Other methods of the library are unaffected. Finally, a second and lesser interdependent bug - a ReDOS - also exhibits when those same line break characters are present in a patch's *patch* header (also known as its \"leading garbage\"). A maliciously-crafted patch header of length *n* can take `parsePatch` O(*n*³) time to parse. Versions 8.0.3, 5.2.2, 4.0.4, and 3.5.1 contain a fix. As a workaround, do not attempt to parse patches that contain any of these characters: `\\r`, `\\u2028`, or `\\u2029`.","cvss":[{"source":"security-advisories@github.com","type":"Secondary","version":"4.0","vector":"CVSS:4.0/AV:N/AC:L/AT:N/PR:N/UI:N/VC:N/VI:N/VA:L/SC:N/SI:N/SA:N/E:U/CR:X/IR:X/AR:X/MAV:X/MAC:X/MAT:X/MPR:X/MUI:X/MVC:X/MVI:X/MVA:X/MSC:X/MSI:X/MSA:X/S:X/AU:X/R:X/V:X/RE:X/U:X","metrics":{"baseScore":2.7},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2026-24001","epss":0.0002,"percentile":0.04802,"date":"2026-02-26"}],"cwes":[{"cve":"CVE-2026-24001","cwe":"CWE-400","source":"security-advisories@github.com","type":"Secondary"},{"cve":"CVE-2026-24001","cwe":"CWE-1333","source":"security-advisories@github.com","type":"Secondary"}]}],"matchDetails":[{"type":"exact-direct-match","matcher":"javascript-matcher","searchedBy":{"language":"javascript","namespace":"github:language:javascript","package":{"name":"diff","version":"5.2.0"}},"found":{"vulnerabilityID":"GHSA-73rr-hh4g-fpgx","versionConstraint":">=5.0.0,<5.2.2 (semantic)"},"fix":{"suggestedVersion":"5.2.2"}}],"artifact":{"id":"b06ad4daeb334cd8","name":"diff","version":"5.2.0","type":"npm","locations":[{"path":"/usr/local/lib/node_modules/npm/node_modules/diff/package.json","layerID":"sha256:3c6d70eb622327a1b441dd21f3762dbe4388412255eee9d2dd74bf16fcc3ed26","accessPath":"/usr/local/lib/node_modules/npm/node_modules/diff/package.json","annotations":{"evidence":"primary"}}],"language":"javascript","licenses":["BSD-3-Clause"],"cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:kpdecker:diff:5.2.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:diff:diff:5.2.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"],"purl":"pkg:npm/diff@5.2.0","upstreams":[]}},{"vulnerability":{"id":"CVE-2023-31438","dataSource":"https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2023-31438","namespace":"debian:distro:debian:12","severity":"Negligible","urls":[],"description":"An issue was discovered in systemd 253.
