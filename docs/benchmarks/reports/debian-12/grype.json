The size parameter must be close enough to PTRDIFF_MAX so as to overflow size_t along with the large alignment argument.  This limits the malicious inputs for the alignment for memalign to the range [1<<62+ 1, 1<<63] and exactly 1<<63 for posix_memalign and aligned_alloc.\n\nTypically the alignment argument passed to such functions is a known constrained quantity (e.g. page size, block size, struct sizes) and is not attacker controlled, because of which this may not be easily exploitable in practice.  An application bug could potentially result in the input alignment being too large, e.g. due to a different buffer overflow or integer overflow in the application or its dependent libraries, but that is again an uncommon usage pattern given typical sources of alignments.","cvss":[{"source":"134c704f-9b21-4f2e-91b3-4a467353bcc0","type":"Secondary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H","metrics":{"baseScore":8.4,"exploitabilityScore":2.6,"impactScore":5.9},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2026-0861","epss":0.00008,"percentile":0.00639,"date":"2026-02-26"}],"cwes":[{"cve":"CVE-2026-0861","cwe":"CWE-190","source":"3ff69d7a-14f2-4f67-a097-88dee7810d18","type":"Secondary"}]}],"matchDetails":[{"type":"exact-indirect-match","matcher":"dpkg-matcher","searchedBy":{"distro":{"type":"debian","version":"12"},"package":{"name":"glibc","version":"2.36-9+deb12u13"},"namespace":"debian:distro:debian:12"},"found":{"vulnerabilityID":"CVE-2026-0861","versionConstraint":"none (unknown)"}}],"artifact":{"id":"6982cd5b1e9b6942","name":"libc6","version":"2.36-9+deb12u13","type":"deb","locations":[{"path":"/var/lib/dpkg/status","layerID":"sha256:936ef6d54e230add6890be5a9fb1faf9c12aeabd6c598d151348ebf84d5a333d","accessPath":"/var/lib/dpkg/status","annotations":{"evidence":"primary"}},{"path":"/usr/share/doc/libc6/copyright","layerID":"sha256:936ef6d54e230add6890be5a9fb1faf9c12aeabd6c598d151348ebf84d5a333d","accessPath":"/usr/share/doc/libc6/copyright","annotations":{"evidence":"supporting"}},{"path":"/var/lib/dpkg/info/libc6:arm64.conffiles","layerID":"sha256:936ef6d54e230add6890be5a9fb1faf9c12aeabd6c598d151348ebf84d5a333d","accessPath":"/var/lib/dpkg/info/libc6:arm64.conffiles","annotations":{"evidence":"supporting"}},{"path":"/var/lib/dpkg/info/libc6:arm64.md5sums","layerID":"sha256:936ef6d54e230add6890be5a9fb1faf9c12aeabd6c598d151348ebf84d5a333d","accessPath":"/var/lib/dpkg/info/libc6:arm64.md5sums","annotations":{"evidence":"supporting"}}],"language":"","licenses":["GPL-2","LGPL-2.1"],"cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:libc6:libc6:2.36-9\\+deb12u13:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"],"purl":"pkg:deb/debian/libc6@2.36-9%2Bdeb12u13?arch=arm64&distro=debian-12&upstream=glibc","upstreams":[{"name":"glibc"}]}},{"vulnerability":{"id":"CVE-2023-31438","dataSource":"https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2023-31438","namespace":"debian:distro:debian:12","severity":"Negligible","urls":[],"description":"An issue was discovered in systemd 253.
