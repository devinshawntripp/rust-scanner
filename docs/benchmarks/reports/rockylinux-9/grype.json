In particular this issue\ncould result in up to 255 bytes of arbitrary private data from memory being sent\nto the peer leading to a loss of confidentiality. However, only applications\nthat directly call the SSL_select_next_proto function with a 0 length list of\nsupported client protocols are affected by this issue. This would normally never\nbe a valid scenario and is typically not under attacker control but may occur by\naccident in the case of a configuration or programming error in the calling\napplication.\n\nThe OpenSSL API function SSL_select_next_proto is typically used by TLS\napplications that support ALPN (Application Layer Protocol Negotiation) or NPN\n(Next Protocol Negotiation). NPN is older, was never standardised and\nis deprecated in favour of ALPN. We believe that ALPN is significantly more\nwidely deployed than NPN. The SSL_select_next_proto function accepts a list of\nprotocols from the server and a list of protocols from the client and returns\nthe first protocol that appears in the server list that also appears in the\nclient list. In the case of no overlap between the two lists it returns the\nfirst item in the client list. In either case it will signal whether an overlap\nbetween the two lists was found. In the case where SSL_select_next_proto is\ncalled with a zero length client list it fails to notice this condition and\nreturns the memory immediately following the client list pointer (and reports\nthat there was no overlap in the lists).\n\nThis function is typically called from a server side application callback for\nALPN or a client side application callback for NPN. In the case of ALPN the list\nof protocols supplied by the client is guaranteed by libssl to never be zero in\nlength. The list of server protocols comes from the application and should never\nnormally be expected to be of zero length. In this case if the\nSSL_select_next_proto function has been called as expected (with the list\nsupplied by the client passed in the client/client_len parameters), then the\napplication will not be vulnerable to this issue. If the application has\naccidentally been configured with a zero length server list, and has\naccidentally passed that zero length server list in the client/client_len\nparameters, and has additionally failed to correctly handle a \"no overlap\"\nresponse (which would normally result in a handshake failure in ALPN) then it\nwill be vulnerable to this problem.\n\nIn the case of NPN, the protocol permits the client to opportunistically select\na protocol when there is no overlap. OpenSSL returns the first client protocol\nin the no overlap case in support of this. The list of client protocols comes\nfrom the application and should never normally be expected to be of zero length.\nHowever if the SSL_select_next_proto function is accidentally called with a\nclient_len of 0 then an invalid memory pointer will be returned instead. If the\napplication uses this output as the opportunistic protocol then the loss of\nconfidentiality will occur.\n\nThis issue has been assessed as Low severity because applications are most\nlikely to be vulnerable if they are using NPN instead of ALPN - but NPN is not\nwidely used. It also requires an application configuration or programming error.\nFinally, this issue would not typically be under attacker control making active\nexploitation unlikely.\n\nThe FIPS modules in 3.3, 3.2, 3.1 and 3.0 are not affected by this issue.\n\nDue to the low severity of this issue we are not issuing new releases of\nOpenSSL at this time.

issue.","cvss":[{"source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H","metrics":{"baseScore":5.5,"exploitabilityScore":1.9,"impactScore":3.6},"vendorMetadata":{}},{"source":"134c704f-9b21-4f2e-91b3-4a467353bcc0","type":"Secondary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H","metrics":{"baseScore":5.5,"exploitabilityScore":1.9,"impactScore":3.6},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2024-0727","epss":0.00236,"percentile":0.46254,"date":"2026-02-26"}],"cwes":[{"cve":"CVE-2024-0727","cwe":"CWE-476","source":"openssl-security@openssl.org","type":"Secondary"},{"cve":"CVE-2024-0727","cwe":"CWE-476","source":"134c704f-9b21-4f2e-91b3-4a467353bcc0","type":"Secondary"}]}],"matchDetails":[{"type":"exact-indirect-match","matcher":"rpm-matcher","searchedBy":{"distro":{"type":"rockylinux","version":"9.3"},"package":{"name":"openssl","version":"3.0.7-24.el9"},"namespace":"redhat:distro:redhat:9"},"found":{"vulnerabilityID":"CVE-2024-0727","versionConstraint":"<

This flaw allows an attacker to trick a user into opening a specially crafted file, triggering an out-of-bounds write that causes an application to crash, possibly executing code and corrupting memory.","cvss":[{"type":"Secondary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H","metrics":{"baseScore":7.8,"exploitabilityScore":1.9,"impactScore":5.9},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2022-2304","epss":0.001,"percentile":0.27784,"date":"2026-02-26"}],"cwes":[{"cve":"CVE-2022-2304","cwe":"CWE-121","source":"security@huntr.dev","type":"Secondary"},{"cve":"CVE-2022-2304","cwe":"CWE-787","source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Secondary"}],"fix":{"versions":[],"state":"not-fixed"},"advisories":[],"risk":0.054},"relatedVulnerabilities":[{"id":"CVE-2022-2304","dataSource":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-2304","namespace":"nvd:cpe","severity":"High","urls":["https://github.com/vim/vim/commit/54e5fed6d27b747ff152cdb6edfb72ff60e70939","https://huntr.dev/bounties/eb7402f3-025a-402f-97a7-c38700d9548a","https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2022/11/msg00009.html","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/43Y3VJPOTTY3NTREDIFUPITM2POG4ZLP/","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/UXPO5EHDV6J4B27E65DOQGZFELUFPRSK/","https://security.gentoo.org/glsa/202208-32","https://security.gentoo.org/glsa/202305-16","https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2025/03/msg00023.html"],"description":"Stack-based Buffer Overflow in GitHub repository vim/vim prior to 9.0.","cvss":[{"source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H","metrics":{"baseScore":7.8,"exploitabilityScore":1.9,"impactScore":5.9},"vendorMetadata":{}},{"source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary","version":"2.0","vector":"AV:N/AC:M/Au:N/C:P/I:P/A:P","metrics":{"baseScore":6.8,"exploitabilityScore":8.6,"impactScore":6.5},"vendorMetadata":{}},{"source":"security@huntr.dev","type":"Secondary","version":"3.0","vector":"CVSS:3.0/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H","metrics":{"baseScore":7.8,"exploitabilityScore":1.9,"impactScore":5.9},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2022-2304","epss":0.001,"percentile":0.27784,"date":"2026-02-26"}],"cwes":[{"cve":"CVE-2022-2304","cwe":"CWE-121","source":"security@huntr.dev","type":"Secondary"},{"cve":"CVE-2022-2304","cwe":"CWE-787","source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Secondary"}]}],"matchDetails":[{"type":"exact-indirect-match","matcher":"rpm-matcher","searchedBy":{"distro":{"type":"rockylinux","version":"9.3"},"package":{"name":"vim","version":"8.2.2637-20.el9_1"},"namespace":"redhat:distro:redhat:9"},"found":{"vulnerabilityID":"CVE-2022-2304","versionConstraint":"none (unknown)"}}],"artifact":{"id":"046d8afc6a55d5bb","name":"vim-minimal","version":"2:8.2.2637-20.el9_1","type":"rpm","locations":[{"path":"/var/lib/rpm/rpmdb.sqlite","layerID":"sha256:fd4d3cdea43d6989fcbb2647c6b5652df2472fd222f26af1c3504543855d1dea","accessPath":"/var/lib/rpm/rpmdb.sqlite","annotations":{"evidence":"primary"}}],"language":"","licenses":["Vim and MIT"],"cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:rockyenterprisesoftwarefoundation:vim-minimal:2\\:8.2.2637-20.el9_1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:rockyenterprisesoftwarefoundation:vim_minimal:2\\:8.2.2637-20.el9_1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:vim-minimal:vim-minimal:2\\:8.2.2637-20.el9_1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:vim-minimal:vim_minimal:2\\:8.2.2637-20.el9_1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:vim_minimal:vim-minimal:2\\:8.2.2637-20.el9_1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:vim_minimal:vim_minimal:2\\:8.2.2637-20.el9_1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:vim:vim-minimal:2\\:8.2.2637-20.el9_1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:vim:vim_minimal:2\\:8.2.2637-20.el9_1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"],"purl":"pkg:rpm/rocky/vim-minimal@8.2.2637-20.el9_1?arch=aarch64&distro=rocky-9.3&epoch=2&upstream=vim-8.2.2637-20.el9_1.src.rpm","upstreams":[{"name":"vim","version":"8.2.2637-20.el9_1"}],"metadataType":"RpmMetadata","metadata":{"epoch":2,"modularityLabel":""}}},{"vulnerability":{"id":"CVE-2022-1674","dataSource":"https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2022-1674","namespace":"redhat:distro:redhat:9","severity":"Low","urls":[],"description":"A NULL pointer dereference flaw was found in vim's vim_regexec_string() function in regexp.c file.

First, the victim must extract an archive that contains a ../ symlink to a critical directory. Second, the victim must extract an archive that contains a critical file, specified via a relative pathname that begins with the symlink name and ends with that critical file's name. Here, the extraction follows the symlink and overwrites the critical file. This bypasses the protection mechanism of \"Member name contains '..'\" that would occur for a single TAR archive that attempted to specify the critical file via a ../ approach. For example, the first archive can contain \"x -> ../../../../../home/victim/.ssh\" and the second archive can contain x/authorized_keys. This can affect server applications that automatically extract any number of user-supplied TAR archives, and were relying on the blocking of traversal. This can also affect software installation processes in which \"tar xf\" is run more than once (e.g., when installing a package can automatically install two dependencies that are set up as untrusted tarballs instead of official packages). NOTE: the official GNU Tar manual has an otherwise-empty directory for each \"tar xf\" in its Security Rules of Thumb; however, third-party advice leads users to run \"tar xf\" more than once into the same directory.","cvss":[{"source":"cve@mitre.org","type":"Secondary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:H/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:N/I:L/A:L","metrics":{"baseScore":4.1,"exploitabilityScore":1.1,"impactScore":2.8},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2025-45582","epss":0.00068,"percentile":0.20998,"date":"2026-02-26"}],"cwes":[{"cve":"CVE-2025-45582","cwe":"CWE-24","source":"cve@mitre.org","type":"Secondary"}]}],"matchDetails":[{"type":"exact-direct-match","matcher":"rpm-matcher","searchedBy":{"distro":{"type":"rockylinux","version":"9.3"},"package":{"name":"tar","version":"2:1.34-6.el9_1"},"namespace":"redhat:distro:redhat:9"},"found":{"vulnerabilityID":"CVE-2025-45582","versionConstraint":"< 2:1.34-9.el9_7 (rpm)"},"fix":{"suggestedVersion":"2:1.34-9.el9_7"}}],"artifact":{"id":"6bd9c3de9f9ee1f3","name":"tar","version":"2:1.34-6.el9_1","type":"rpm","locations":[{"path":"/var/lib/rpm/rpmdb.sqlite","layerID":"sha256:fd4d3cdea43d6989fcbb2647c6b5652df2472fd222f26af1c3504543855d1dea","accessPath":"/var/lib/rpm/rpmdb.sqlite","annotations":{"evidence":"primary"}}],"language":"","licenses":["GPLv3+"],"cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:rockyenterprisesoftwarefoundation:tar:2\\:1.34-6.el9_1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:tar:tar:2\\:1.34-6.el9_1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"],"purl":"pkg:rpm/rocky/tar@1.34-6.el9_1?arch=aarch64&distro=rocky-9.3&epoch=2&upstream=tar-1.34-6.el9_1.src.rpm","upstreams":[],"metadataType":"RpmMetadata","metadata":{"epoch":2,"modularityLabel":""}}},{"vulnerability":{"id":"CVE-2025-22134","dataSource":"https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2025-22134","namespace":"redhat:distro:redhat:9","severity":"Low","urls":[],"description":"A flaw was found in Vim.

The issue has been fixed as of Vim patch v9.1.0648.","cvss":[{"source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:H/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:L","metrics":{"baseScore":4.2,"exploitabilityScore":0.8,"impactScore":3.4},"vendorMetadata":{}},{"source":"security-advisories@github.com","type":"Secondary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:H/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:L","metrics":{"baseScore":4.2,"exploitabilityScore":0.8,"impactScore":3.4},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2024-41965","epss":0.00093,"percentile":0.26048,"date":"2026-02-26"}],"cwes":[{"cve":"CVE-2024-41965","cwe":"CWE-416","source":"security-advisories@github.com","type":"Secondary"},{"cve":"CVE-2024-41965","cwe":"CWE-415","source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary"}]}],"matchDetails":[{"type":"exact-indirect-match","matcher":"rpm-matcher","searchedBy":{"distro":{"type":"rockylinux","version":"9.3"},"package":{"name":"vim","version":"8.2.2637-20.el9_1"},"namespace":"redhat:distro:redhat:9"},"found":{"vulnerabilityID":"CVE-2024-41965","versionConstraint":"none (unknown)"}}],"artifact":{"id":"046d8afc6a55d5bb","name":"vim-minimal","version":"2:8.2.2637-20.el9_1","type":"rpm","locations":[{"path":"/var/lib/rpm/rpmdb.sqlite","layerID":"sha256:fd4d3cdea43d6989fcbb2647c6b5652df2472fd222f26af1c3504543855d1dea","accessPath":"/var/lib/rpm/rpmdb.sqlite","annotations":{"evidence":"primary"}}],"language":"","licenses":["Vim and MIT"],"cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:rockyenterprisesoftwarefoundation:vim-minimal:2\\:8.2.2637-20.el9_1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:rockyenterprisesoftwarefoundation:vim_minimal:2\\:8.2.2637-20.el9_1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:vim-minimal:vim-minimal:2\\:8.2.2637-20.el9_1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:vim-minimal:vim_minimal:2\\:8.2.2637-20.el9_1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:vim_minimal:vim-minimal:2\\:8.2.2637-20.el9_1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:vim_minimal:vim_minimal:2\\:8.2.2637-20.el9_1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:vim:vim-minimal:2\\:8.2.2637-20.el9_1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:vim:vim_minimal:2\\:8.2.2637-20.el9_1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"],"purl":"pkg:rpm/rocky/vim-minimal@8.2.2637-20.el9_1?arch=aarch64&distro=rocky-9.3&epoch=2&upstream=vim-8.2.2637-20.el9_1.src.rpm","upstreams":[{"name":"vim","version":"8.2.2637-20.el9_1"}],"metadataType":"RpmMetadata","metadata":{"epoch":2,"modularityLabel":""}}},{"vulnerability":{"id":"CVE-2024-29040","dataSource":"https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2024-29040","namespace":"redhat:distro:redhat:9","severity":"Medium","urls":[],"description":"A flaw was found in the tpm2-tss package, where it was not checked to see if the magic number in the attest is equal to the TPM2_GENERATED_VALUE.

When flushing the typeahead buffer, Vim moves the current position in the typeahead buffer but does not check whether there is enough space left in the buffer to handle the next characters.  So this may lead to the tb_off position within the typebuf variable to point outside of the valid buffer size, which can then later lead to a heap-buffer overflow in e.g. ins_typebuf(). Therefore, when flushing the typeahead buffer, check if there is enough space left before advancing the off position. If not, fall back to flush current typebuf contents. It's not quite clear yet, what can lead to this situation. It seems to happen when error messages occur (which will cause Vim to flush the typeahead buffer) in comnination with several long mappgins and so it may eventually move the off position out of a valid buffer size. Impact is low since it is not easily reproducible and requires to have several mappings active and run into some error condition. But when this happens, this will cause a crash. The issue has been fixed as of Vim patch v9.1.0697. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this issue.","cvss":[{"source":"security-advisories@github.com","type":"Secondary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:H/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:L","metrics":{"baseScore":4.5,"exploitabilityScore":1.1,"impactScore":3.4},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2024-43802","epss":0.00077,"percentile":0.23031,"date":"2026-02-26"}],"cwes":[{"cve":"CVE-2024-43802","cwe":"CWE-122","source":"security-advisories@github.com","type":"Secondary"}]}],"matchDetails":[{"type":"exact-indirect-match","matcher":"rpm-matcher","searchedBy":{"distro":{"type":"rockylinux","version":"9.3"},"package":{"name":"vim","version":"8.2.2637-20.el9_1"},"namespace":"redhat:distro:redhat:9"},"found":{"vulnerabilityID":"CVE-2024-43802","versionConstraint":"none (unknown)"}}],"artifact":{"id":"046d8afc6a55d5bb","name":"vim-minimal","version":"2:8.2.2637-20.el9_1","type":"rpm","locations":[{"path":"/var/lib/rpm/rpmdb.sqlite","layerID":"sha256:fd4d3cdea43d6989fcbb2647c6b5652df2472fd222f26af1c3504543855d1dea","accessPath":"/var/lib/rpm/rpmdb.sqlite","annotations":{"evidence":"primary"}}],"language":"","licenses":["Vim and MIT"],"cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:rockyenterprisesoftwarefoundation:vim-minimal:2\\:8.2.2637-20.el9_1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:rockyenterprisesoftwarefoundation:vim_minimal:2\\:8.2.2637-20.el9_1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:vim-minimal:vim-minimal:2\\:8.2.2637-20.el9_1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:vim-minimal:vim_minimal:2\\:8.2.2637-20.el9_1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:vim_minimal:vim-minimal:2\\:8.2.2637-20.el9_1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:vim_minimal:vim_minimal:2\\:8.2.2637-20.el9_1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:vim:vim-minimal:2\\:8.2.2637-20.el9_1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:vim:vim_minimal:2\\:8.2.2637-20.el9_1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"],"purl":"pkg:rpm/rocky/vim-minimal@8.2.2637-20.el9_1?arch=aarch64&distro=rocky-9.3&epoch=2&upstream=vim-8.2.2637-20.el9_1.src.rpm","upstreams":[{"name":"vim","version":"8.2.2637-20.el9_1"}],"metadataType":"RpmMetadata","metadata":{"epoch":2,"modularityLabel":""}}},{"vulnerability":{"id":"CVE-2022-3297","dataSource":"https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2022-3297","namespace":"redhat:distro:redhat:9","severity":"Low","urls":[],"description":"A heap use-after-free vulnerability was found in Vim's process_next_cpt_value() function of the src/insexpand.c file.

Impact is low since the user must have intentionally set up such a strange auto command and run some buffer unload commands. However this may lead to a crash. This issue has been addressed in version 9.1.0764 and all users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.","cvss":[{"source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H","metrics":{"baseScore":4.7,"exploitabilityScore":1.1,"impactScore":3.6},"vendorMetadata":{}},{"source":"security-advisories@github.com","type":"Secondary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:L","metrics":{"baseScore":3.9,"exploitabilityScore":1.4,"impactScore":2.6},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2024-47814","epss":0.00069,"percentile":0.21186,"date":"2026-02-26"}],"cwes":[{"cve":"CVE-2024-47814","cwe":"CWE-416","source":"security-advisories@github.com","type":"Secondary"}]}],"matchDetails":[{"type":"exact-indirect-match","matcher":"rpm-matcher","searchedBy":{"distro":{"type":"rockylinux","version":"9.3"},"package":{"name":"vim","version":"8.2.2637-20.el9_1"},"namespace":"redhat:distro:redhat:9"},"found":{"vulnerabilityID":"CVE-2024-47814","versionConstraint":"none (unknown)"}}],"artifact":{"id":"046d8afc6a55d5bb","name":"vim-minimal","version":"2:8.2.2637-20.el9_1","type":"rpm","locations":[{"path":"/var/lib/rpm/rpmdb.sqlite","layerID":"sha256:fd4d3cdea43d6989fcbb2647c6b5652df2472fd222f26af1c3504543855d1dea","accessPath":"/var/lib/rpm/rpmdb.sqlite","annotations":{"evidence":"primary"}}],"language":"","licenses":["Vim and MIT"],"cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:rockyenterprisesoftwarefoundation:vim-minimal:2\\:8.2.2637-20.el9_1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:rockyenterprisesoftwarefoundation:vim_minimal:2\\:8.2.2637-20.el9_1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:vim-minimal:vim-minimal:2\\:8.2.2637-20.el9_1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:vim-minimal:vim_minimal:2\\:8.2.2637-20.el9_1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:vim_minimal:vim-minimal:2\\:8.2.2637-20.el9_1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:vim_minimal:vim_minimal:2\\:8.2.2637-20.el9_1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:vim:vim-minimal:2\\:8.2.2637-20.el9_1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:vim:vim_minimal:2\\:8.2.2637-20.el9_1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"],"purl":"pkg:rpm/rocky/vim-minimal@8.2.2637-20.el9_1?arch=aarch64&distro=rocky-9.3&epoch=2&upstream=vim-8.2.2637-20.el9_1.src.rpm","upstreams":[{"name":"vim","version":"8.2.2637-20.el9_1"}],"metadataType":"RpmMetadata","metadata":{"epoch":2,"modularityLabel":""}}},{"vulnerability":{"id":"CVE-2022-2980","dataSource":"https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2022-2980","namespace":"redhat:distro:redhat:9","severity":"Low","urls":[],"description":"A NULL pointer dereference vulnerability was found in vim's do_mouse() function of the src/mouse.c file.

Although this behavior is not specified in the section for redirects, it can be inferred by piecing together information from different sections and we have observed the behavior in other major HTTP client implementations like curl and web browsers. Because the vulnerability requires a previously trusted service to become compromised in order to have an impact on confidentiality we believe the exploitability of this vulnerability is low. Additionally, many users aren't putting sensitive data in HTTP request bodies, if this is the case then this vulnerability isn't exploitable. Both of the following conditions must be true to be affected by this vulnerability: 1. Using urllib3 and submitting sensitive information in the HTTP request body (such as form data or JSON) and 2. The origin service is compromised and starts redirecting using 301, 302, or 303 to a malicious peer or the redirected-to service becomes compromised. This issue has been addressed in versions 1.26.18 and 2.0.7 and users are advised to update to resolve this issue. Users unable to update should disable redirects for services that aren't expecting to respond with redirects with `redirects=False` and disable automatic redirects with `redirects=False` and handle 301, 302, and 303 redirects manually by stripping the HTTP request body.","cvss":[{"source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:A/AC:H/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N","metrics":{"baseScore":4.2,"exploitabilityScore":0.6,"impactScore":3.6},"vendorMetadata":{}},{"source":"security-advisories@github.com","type":"Secondary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:A/AC:H/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N","metrics":{"baseScore":4.2,"exploitabilityScore":0.6,"impactScore":3.6},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2023-45803","epss":0.00051,"percentile":0.15767,"date":"2026-02-26"}],"cwes":[{"cve":"CVE-2023-45803","cwe":"CWE-200","source":"security-advisories@github.com","type":"Secondary"}]}],"matchDetails":[{"type":"exact-indirect-match","matcher":"rpm-matcher","searchedBy":{"distro":{"type":"rockylinux","version":"9.3"},"package":{"name":"python-pip","version":"21.2.3-7.el9"},"namespace":"redhat:distro:redhat:9"},"found":{"vulnerabilityID":"CVE-2023-45803","versionConstraint":"none

Vim allows to redirect screen messages using the `:redir` ex command to register, variables and files. It also allows to show the contents of registers using the `:registers` or `:display` ex command. When redirecting the output of `:display` to a register, Vim will free the register content before storing the new content in the register. Now when redirecting the `:display` command to a register that is being displayed, Vim will free the content while shortly afterwards trying to access it, which leads to a use-after-free. Vim pre 9.1.1115 checks in the ex_display() function, that it does not try to redirect to a register while displaying this register at the same time. However this check is not complete, and so Vim does not check the `+` and `*` registers (which typically donate the X11/clipboard registers, and when a clipboard connection is not possible will fall back to use register 0 instead.

An attacker can trick a user into opening a specially crafted file, triggering an issue that causes an application to crash leading to a denial of service, corrupting memory, and possibly executing code.","cvss":[{"type":"Secondary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:L","metrics":{"baseScore":5.3,"exploitabilityScore":1.9,"impactScore":3.4},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2023-1175","epss":0.00031,"percentile":0.085,"date":"2026-02-26"}],"cwes":[{"cve":"CVE-2023-1175","cwe":"CWE-131","source":"security@huntr.dev","type":"Secondary"}],"fix":{"versions":[],"state":"not-fixed"},"advisories":[],"risk":0.012865000000000001},"relatedVulnerabilities":[{"id":"CVE-2023-1175","dataSource":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-1175","namespace":"nvd:cpe","severity":"Medium","urls":["https://github.com/vim/vim/commit/c99cbf8f289bdda5d4a77d7ec415850a520330ba","https://huntr.dev/bounties/7e93fc17-92eb-4ae7-b01a-93bb460b643e","https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2023/06/msg00015.html","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/DIAKPMKJ4OZ6NYRZJO7YWMNQL2BICLYV/","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/IE44W6WMMREYCW3GJHPSYP7NK2VT5NY6/","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/X4KDAU76Z7QNSPKZX2JAJ6O7KIEOXWTL/","https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2025/03/msg00023.html"],"description":"Incorrect Calculation of Buffer Size in GitHub repository vim/vim prior to 9.0.1378.","cvss":[{"source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:H","metrics":{"baseScore":6.6,"exploitabilityScore":1.9,"impactScore":4.8},"vendorMetadata":{}},{"source":"security@huntr.dev","type":"Secondary","version":"3.0","vector":"CVSS:3.0/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H","metrics":{"baseScore":7.3,"exploitabilityScore":1.4,"impactScore":5.9},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2023-1175","epss":0.00031,"percentile":0.085,"date":"2026-02-26"}],"cwes":[{"cve":"CVE-2023-1175","cwe":"CWE-131","source":"security@huntr.dev","type":"Secondary"}]}],"matchDetails":[{"type":"exact-indirect-match","matcher":"rpm-matcher","searchedBy":{"distro":{"type":"rockylinux","version":"9.3"},"package":{"name":"vim","version":"8.2.2637-20.el9_1"},"namespace":"redhat:distro:redhat:9"},"found":{"vulnerabilityID":"CVE-2023-1175","versionConstraint":"none (unknown)"}}],"artifact":{"id":"046d8afc6a55d5bb","name":"vim-minimal","version":"2:8.2.2637-20.el9_1","type":"rpm","locations":[{"path":"/var/lib/rpm/rpmdb.sqlite","layerID":"sha256:fd4d3cdea43d6989fcbb2647c6b5652df2472fd222f26af1c3504543855d1dea","accessPath":"/var/lib/rpm/rpmdb.sqlite","annotations":{"evidence":"primary"}}],"language":"","licenses":["Vim and MIT"],"cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:rockyenterprisesoftwarefoundation:vim-minimal:2\\:8.2.2637-20.el9_1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:rockyenterprisesoftwarefoundation:vim_minimal:2\\:8.2.2637-20.el9_1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:vim-minimal:vim-minimal:2\\:8.2.2637-20.el9_1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:vim-minimal:vim_minimal:2\\:8.2.2637-20.el9_1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:vim_minimal:vim-minimal:2\\:8.2.2637-20.el9_1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:vim_minimal:vim_minimal:2\\:8.2.2637-20.el9_1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:vim:vim-minimal:2\\:8.2.2637-20.el9_1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:vim:vim_minimal:2\\:8.2.2637-20.el9_1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"],"purl":"pkg:rpm/rocky/vim-minimal@8.2.2637-20.el9_1?arch=aarch64&distro=rocky-9.3&epoch=2&upstream=vim-8.2.2637-20.el9_1.src.rpm","upstreams":[{"name":"vim","version":"8.2.2637-20.el9_1"}],"metadataType":"RpmMetadata","metadata":{"epoch":2,"modularityLabel":""}}},{"vulnerability":{"id":"CVE-2022-2874","dataSource":"https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2022-2874","namespace":"redhat:distro:redhat:9","severity":"Low","urls":[],"description":"A NULL pointer dereference vulnerability was found in Vim in the generate_loadvar function in the vim9compile.c file.

This bug affects libarchive versions prior to 3.8.0.","cvss":[{"source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:H","metrics":{"baseScore":5.6,"exploitabilityScore":1.4,"impactScore":4.3},"vendorMetadata":{}},{"source":"secalert@redhat.com","type":"Secondary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:L","metrics":{"baseScore":3.9,"exploitabilityScore":1.4,"impactScore":2.6},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2025-5916","epss":0.00034,"percentile":0.09672,"date":"2026-02-26"}],"cwes":[{"cve":"CVE-2025-5916","cwe":"CWE-190","source":"secalert@redhat.com","type":"Secondary"}]}],"matchDetails":[{"type":"exact-direct-match","matcher":"rpm-matcher","searchedBy":{"distro":{"type":"rockylinux","version":"9.3"},"package":{"name":"libarchive","version":"0:3.5.3-4.el9"},"namespace":"redhat:distro:redhat:9"},"found":{"vulnerabilityID":"CVE-2025-5916","versionConstraint":"none (unknown)"}}],"artifact":{"id":"4cdbe260ee777fa0","name":"libarchive","version":"3.5.3-4.el9","type":"rpm","locations":[{"path":"/var/lib/rpm/rpmdb.sqlite","layerID":"sha256:fd4d3cdea43d6989fcbb2647c6b5652df2472fd222f26af1c3504543855d1dea","accessPath":"/var/lib/rpm/rpmdb.sqlite","annotations":{"evidence":"primary"}}],"language":"","licenses":["BSD"],"cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:rockyenterprisesoftwarefoundation:libarchive:3.5.3-4.el9:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:libarchive:libarchive:3.5.3-4.el9:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"],"purl":"pkg:rpm/rocky/libarchive@3.5.3-4.el9?arch=aarch64&distro=rocky-9.3&upstream=libarchive-3.5.3-4.el9.src.rpm","upstreams":[],"metadataType":"RpmMetadata","metadata":{"epoch":null,"modularityLabel":""}}},{"vulnerability":{"id":"CVE-2025-6020","dataSource":"https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2025-6020","namespace":"redhat:distro:redhat:9","severity":"High","urls":[],"description":"A flaw was found in linux-pam.

This \nvulnerability stems from a failure to constrain the redirect target.","cvss":[{"type":"Secondary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N","metrics":{"baseScore":5.3,"exploitabilityScore":1.7,"impactScore":3.6},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2025-50182","epss":0.00016,"percentile":0.03185,"date":"2026-02-26"}],"cwes":[{"cve":"CVE-2025-50182","cwe":"CWE-601","source":"security-advisories@github.com","type":"Secondary"}],"fix":{"versions":[],"state":"not-fixed"},"advisories":[],"risk":0.00824},"relatedVulnerabilities":[{"id":"CVE-2025-50182","dataSource":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-50182","namespace":"nvd:cpe","severity":"Medium","urls":["https://github.com/urllib3/urllib3/commit/7eb4a2aafe49a279c29b6d1f0ed0f42e9736194f","https://github.com/urllib3/urllib3/releases/tag/2.5.0","https://github.com/urllib3/urllib3/security/advisories/GHSA-48p4-8xcf-vxj5"],"description":"urllib3 is a user-friendly HTTP client library for Python.

This can lead to unauthorized access and modification of sensitive system files.","cvss":[{"type":"Secondary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N","metrics":{"baseScore":7.1,"exploitabilityScore":1.9,"impactScore":5.2},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2026-26960","epss":0.00012,"percentile":0.01738,"date":"2026-02-26"}],"cwes":[{"cve":"CVE-2026-26960","cwe":"CWE-22","source":"security-advisories@github.com","type":"Primary"}],"fix":{"versions":[],"state":"not-fixed"},"advisories":[],"risk":0.00726},"relatedVulnerabilities":[{"id":"CVE-2026-26960","dataSource":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2026-26960","namespace":"nvd:cpe","severity":"High","urls":["https://github.com/isaacs/node-tar/commit/2cb1120bcefe28d7ecc719b41441ade59c52e384","https://github.com/isaacs/node-tar/commit/d18e4e1f846f4ddddc153b0f536a19c050e7499f","https://github.com/isaacs/node-tar/security/advisories/GHSA-83g3-92jg-28cx"],"description":"node-tar is a full-featured Tar for Node.js.
